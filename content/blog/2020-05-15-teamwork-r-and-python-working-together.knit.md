Hello World! 

I'm so excited because... this is my first blogpost EVER!!!

![](/blog/2020-05-15-teamwork-r-and-python-working-together_files/excited.jpg)

Anyways, through Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in my last semester senior year, I have learned a small amount of Python and (a smidge more) and R Studio. Here are some of the basics in each program!


```r
#R code
hi <- "hello"
hi
```

```
## [1] "hello"
```

```r
1+2
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
#plot
plot(cars)
```

```r
library(reticulate)
```

```
## Warning: package 'reticulate' was built under R version 3.6.3
```

```r
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python")
use_python("usr/bin/python")
```
